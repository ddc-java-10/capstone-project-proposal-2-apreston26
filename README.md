# Flipp Flopp 

A platformer that has unique objects that will make platforms either disappear or appear and as standard in these games they get progressively harder as the user progresses. The player will have to use Flipps and Flopps to reach the end of each level. A Flipp would make the platforms disappear and a Flopp would make objects appear. Along with the base game, the players are also timed and racing against each other for a spot on the leaderboard.
